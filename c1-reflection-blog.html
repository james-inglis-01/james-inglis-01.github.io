    <p>
        <strong>What's your take on the EDA experience?</strong><br>
        I feel like the whole experience is going to be very intense but also very rewarding.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What are your impressions?</strong><br>
        EDA seems to be the most professional and thorough education provider when it comes to web development.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong><br>
        I'm looking forward to working with the other students in my cohort, it seems like we're all on the same page when it comes to learning code.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong><br>
        Not really, I always knew it was my responsibility at the end of the day to learn and get a job out of this.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong><br>
        Yes I'm excited to get going and see how the meditation and yoga will be incorporated into the course, I think it'll be good for me to go through a different sort of learning experience to what I'm used to.
