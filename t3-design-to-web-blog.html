      <p class="para">Responsive design means that no matter which device you use to view a web page,
      the content will fit and look good regardless of the size of the screen. This is
      important because according to Google &#8220;we live in a mobile-first world: In an
      average day, more than 1/4 of all users only use a smartphone, which is nearly 2X
      as many as those who only use a computer.&#8221; Mobile first design is an approach
      to making web pages that starts with making things work for mobile devices first
      (which are more difficult) and then moving onto larger devices like laptops which
      will be a bit easier. A web framework is something used by developers to speed up
      the process of making a website or app. A framework provides the fundamental code
      as opposed to the developers having to do it themselves, this means it
      doesn&#8217;t take as long therefore is more efficient. Because it shortens
      development time this means less cost to the client. It can also automate common
      activities performed in web development. For example, many web frameworks provide
      libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and
      they often promote code reuse. The downsides of using a framework are that it may
      be a bit prohibitive when implementing complex functions or styles, you need to
      respect the limits of the framework. Using a framework doesn&#8217;t necessarily
      mean you learn the coding language within it. The framework code is usually public
      meaning that it&#8217;s also open to people who may want to exploit it for their
      own gain. Wireframes are visual guides used by developers to plan the basic design
      of a website. Wireframes mock-up different layouts, sizes and shapes of elements to
      find out what will best serve the website&#8217;s main purpose.
      I found the elements below the header to be the most difficult to implement
      using the skeleton column system. I think this was due to the style rules in my
      main.css stylesheet and as of right now I&#8217;m still tinkering to get the layout
      I planned.</p>
