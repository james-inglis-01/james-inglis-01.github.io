<h1>Personal Site Design</h1>

<h3>What is you site's primary purpose?</h3>
<br>
<p>
  My site's primary purpose is to document my web development journey, from novice through to professional and showcase my work. This site will show people what I'm capable and how they can contact me.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
<br>
<p>
  Other than my fellow cohort members, my target audience are people curious about learning web development, and also potential employers who would like to see some of my work.
</p>
<br>
<h3>How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?</h3>
<br>
<p>
  I'd like users to be able to navigate around my site easily by clicking on links which are neatly organised. I'd like to have a minimalist design that showcases my technical ability, but isn't distracting.
</p>
<br>
<h3>How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?</h3>
<p>
  I'll start by using the skeleton framework to create a responsive site, following the 'mobile first' philosophy. I'll choose only two typefaces which complement each other. I'll also make links obvious by giving them a unique colour when you hover over them.
