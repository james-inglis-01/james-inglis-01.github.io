            <h2>Design and structural features I'd like to incorporate into my website:</h2>

    <ul class="features">
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/stream">SoundCloud's</a> navbar (or something similar) to make it simple for the user to move around the website</li>
        <li>I like the menu that drops down on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mightyape.co.nz/">Mighty Ape</a> when you click on departments</li>
        <li>The use of horizontal sections on this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/215/">CSS Zen Garden</a> site looks really clean, organised and easy for the user to navigate through
    </ul>

        <strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong><br>
        I would describe it as a house and a piece of land. The Document Object Model (DOM) can be viewed as the architectâ€™s outline of the house. The DOM dictates the basic order that the rest of the code on the web page will conform to. HTML can be seen as the main parts of the house. The foundations, roof and walls are like content on a web page e.g. headers, divs and paragraphs.
        Whereas the CSS can be compared to decorative features in a house such as paint, tiles and fixtures.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong><br>
        Boxifying basically refers to the act of dividing up a web page by separating all the visual elements on the page into boxes. For example icons, headings, paragraphs and pictures are all separate boxes which comprise a complete web page when put together.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What is the box model?</strong><br>
        The box model refers to the fact that every HTML element is surrounded by
        a series of boxes. Starting with the content itself at the centre, then padding, border and finally the margin. All of these components are able to be changed and styled to suit your needs.
