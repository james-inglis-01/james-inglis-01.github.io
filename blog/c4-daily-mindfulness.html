              <strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong><br />
              I learned that the way we interpret what others say may differ greatly from what they actually mean. It took a few ‘loops’ to figure things out but after that I felt like we both felt understood. I found it pretty hard to talk for 3-4 minutes so inevitably there was a bit of silent mindfulness going on. ‘Dipping’ wasn’t too difficult though because I feel like I do this already, when I’m listening to someone I take note of how I’m feeling pretty regularly. The other person who is a friend, thought it was an interesting idea and was open to trying it. At times I think it was a bit hard for both of us to articulate exactly what the other person meant, but they seemed to enjoy it.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong><br />
              I like the idea of walking meditation because I think I take simple things like walking and my health for granted sometimes. I can practice informal mindful conversation on a daily basis by giving the other person my undivided attention when listening. Mingyur Rinpoche says we can do a bit less than what we are capable of to make meditation feel like less of a chore. Meng also says that one mindful breath a day is also a viable form of practicing, and I think I’m more than capable of doing that!
