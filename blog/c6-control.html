            <p><strong>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong><br>
              While learning how to code there have been several instances where I’ve lost my cool a bit. It usually happens when I feel like I’ve tried everything, and a piece of code still won’t work. The main feeling that arises out of these situations is one of extreme frustration. I suppose it elicits a strong reaction because I feel like I’m inadequate, and not keeping up with the others. I put quite a lot of pressure on myself, and when things don’t work out the way they’re supposed to, I have a hard time accepting it.<br>
              This feeling manifests in my upper body mostly, I get a bit hot and feel like I’m being wound up like a spring. Chade-Meng Tan says that we can lessen these negative effects by not feeding those negative feelings by telling ourselves stories about our shortcomings. Instead we should greet all thoughts and feelings good and bad with kindness and humour.<br>
              <br><strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</strong><br>
              I thought it was a really good way to regain control over the self at times when things aren’t going as planned. A lot of the time I still don’t realise when I’m feeling these negative emotions so that is obviously the first thing I have to work on. But once I’ve realised the feelings the Siberian railroad looks like it could be a really productive way of dealing with my frustrations.<br>
