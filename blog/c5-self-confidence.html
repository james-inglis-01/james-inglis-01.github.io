              <strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</strong><br />
              Mindfulness and self-awareness both refer to being able to look at your emotions and thoughts objectively, without being caught up in them. But they do differ in subtle ways, for example mindfulness refers to focusing on one thing in particular as and when you decide to. And doing without judging yourself. Self-awareness is more about maintaining a general sense of neutrality even when you find yourself in stressful/emotional situations.<br />

              <br /><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong><br />
              I tried the body scan task and found that very calming. I have tried a similar exercise through the Headspace app however it wasn’t quite as detailed. I am pretty confident in my abilities when it comes to self-awareness, especially in regards to my body. I’m able to notice subtle changes that are of a physical nature, so doing the body scan wasn’t too difficult. I also found that focusing on different areas of your body is a good way to keep focused on one thing, and limit distractions.<br />

              <br /><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong><br />
              I learned that it’s perfectly normal to feel a wide array of emotions. But it’s important that we try to have the self-awareness to let them come and go as we do with our thoughts when meditating. It’s better to be experiential than existential with emotions, saying “I feel angry” instead of “I am angry.” I like to compare thoughts and emotions to cars on a road. It’s better to observe them from the side of the road than to waste time running after and trying to catch them.
