      Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?
      I tried the Pomodoro technique of using 25 minutes at a time to work on something then give myself a 5 minute break.

      What did you find interesting?
      I found it interesting that in order to create a new habit the task needs to be simple when you're starting out. Combining these small habits over time is what leads to major changes in your life.

      What worked for you?
      I find that meditating for 15 minutes really calms me and gives me intense focus once I've snapped out of it. I've been meditating for a few months now and it's really helping to reduce anxiety also.

      Which will you experiment further with?
      I'll create a habit of practicing my touch typing on http://www.typingstudy.com/ each day to improve my skills.
