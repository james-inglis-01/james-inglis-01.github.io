            <p><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong><br>
              To be honest I think we all know that we should be limiting the fleeting pleasures of life and striving for sustaining a more purposeful life complimented by a passionate job path. It’s a bit like the food pyramid in that too many lollies are going to bad for you in the long run! However this is not so easy, I’d like to think I’m on the right path though what with doing this course at EDA and learning how to take better care of myself.<br />
              <br /><strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</strong><br />
              <strong>What are your core values?</strong><br />
              I would say my core values are honesty, loyalty and self-discipline.<br />
              <br /><strong>What do you stand for?</strong><br />
              Apart from creating a safe, happy and prosperous life for myself and my family. I stand for fairness on an interpersonal level and on a national and global level, especially when it comes to democracy, politics and wealth distribution<br />
              <br /><strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong><br />
              I didn’t really enjoy this exercise, I have enough trouble as it is focusing on my successes failures. Usually focusing too much on the latter. I understand the concept realising that failure and success are just emotional responses that don’t have to dictate our overall mental state. I suppose I just have to work on this more.
