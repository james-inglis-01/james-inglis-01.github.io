                <strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong><br>
                I learned that in most aspects of life, to be truly successful you need to have a firm grasp on emotional intelligence. Whether you’re an engineer or a naval officer, being open honest and positive creates an atmosphere conducive to greater productivity. I also learned that you can train your brain to be able to deal with emotions in a more productive way. Neuroplasticity takes time but it has been proven with London taxi drivers, after learning the roads of the city their hippocampus was larger than normal. The same concept can be used with mindfulness eventually people can become like Neo in the matrix and see emotions arising in themselves and become expert at managing them.<br>
                <br><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong><br>
                I tried the ‘easier’ method of just being in the moment for two minutes, as I’ve gotten used to meditating for 10 to 15 minutes so I thought I’d try something different. It was a nice break from being around devices all day, but I didn’t get the same feeling of calmness and focus I get from meditating.<br>
