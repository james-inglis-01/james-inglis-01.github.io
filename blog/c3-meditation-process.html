                <strong>
                  How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?
                </strong>
                <br />
                The process over product approach caused me to spend less time on styling my site and more time focusing on the new framework and getting it to work properly.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>
                  What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
                </strong>
                <br />
                Before reading the second chapter of Search Inside Yourself I’d been getting into the habit of meditating for ten minutes, with the goal being to do it everyday. Prior to starting the EDA bootcamp I’d been introduced to mindfulness meditation in order to deal with pre-existing anxiety issues. I found that meditation was a great tool to lessen the effect of anxiety both physically and mentally.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>
                  What new things have you learnt about meditation?
                </strong>
                <br />
                After reading the latest chapter I learned that the act of realising when you’re getting distracted and bringing attention back to your breathing is similar to building muscles at the gym. Eventually you’ll be able to get to the point that you’ll be able to relax and focus on things much better, even when you’re not meditating.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>
                  Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?
                </strong>
                <br />
                I think I’ll probably pay more attention to my posture more when I meditate. I tend to slouch a bit while meditating, Meng suggests a straighter back is recommended.
