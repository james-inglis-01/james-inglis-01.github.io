    <p>What's your take on the EDA experience?
      I feel like the whole experience is going to be very intense but also very rewarding.
      What are your impressions?
      EDA seems to be the most professional and thorough education provdider when it comes
      to web development.
      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
      I'm looking forward to working with the other students in my cohort, it seems like
      we're all on the same page when it comes to learning code.
      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
      Not really, I always knew it was my responsibility at the end of the day to learn and get
      a job out of this.
      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you
      nervous?
      Yes I'm excited to get going and see how the meditation and yoga will be incorporated into the course,
      I think it'll be good for me to go through a different sort of learning experience to what I'm used to.
