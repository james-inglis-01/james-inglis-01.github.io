    <h1>Reflection</h1>

    <p>
        What's your take on the EDA experience?<br>
        I feel like the whole experience is going to be very intense but also very rewarding.<br>
        What are your impressions?<br>
        EDA seems to be the most professional and thorough education provdider when it comes to web development.<br>
        How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?<br>
        I'm looking forward to working with the other students in my cohort, it seems like we're all on the same page when it comes to learning code.<br>
        Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?<br>
        Not really, I always knew it was my responsibility at the end of the day to learn and get a job out of this.<br>
        Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<br>
        Yes I'm excited to get going and see how the meditation and yoga will be incorporated into the course, I think it'll be good for me to go through a different sort of learning experience to what I'm used to.
