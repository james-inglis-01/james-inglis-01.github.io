              In the early weeks at EDA there was the task of redesigning your website to make it responsive. I encountered a problem with the Skeleton framework we were supposed to use for this task. A framework is a way of using a bare-bones structure that you fill in with your own content, to expedite the process of making a website. The problem I encountered was that the images I wanted to use, were not scaling-down properly when I changed the size of the window.<br />
              The main techniques I used to tackle this problem was to search Google for ways to make images responsive. I suppose that I used a mixture of pseudocode as well as just trying something, to at least have a go at fixing the problem and testing it to see if it worked. In the end the Googling led me back to the Skeleton documentation which had the answer I needed. I simply had to add a specific class to the image tag in the html to make it all work responsively.<br />
              I’m not going to lie, I felt a bit frustrated with this problem when it first arose. I always felt like I was on the cusp of the answer so I wasn’t too stressed. I learned that the best way to tackle a problem is to at least make a start by getting some code done and then go from there. Also it doesn’t hurt to try different methods of problem solving if something isn’t working.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Pseudocode</strong><br>
              I haven’t done a whole lot of pseudocoding yet but what I have done was quite helpful. It’s good to at least get some code into a file and test it out, rather than just sitting there thinking about what you need to do.<br>
              <br><strong>Trying something</strong><br>
              Trying something is the second-favorite method of problem solving, like I mentioned before procrastinating and not trying something is never going to help the situation. Even if you try something for at least 15 minutes you can say you gave it a go.<br>
              <br><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong><br>
              I’ve never used the rubber ducky method, and to be quite honest wouldn’t be comfortable with it...it seems kinda silly but I’ll try anything once.
              <br><strong>Reading error messages</strong><br>
              Sometimes I have a bit of trouble deciphering error messages but it can be a very useful way of troubleshooting code.<br>
              <br><strong>Console.logging</strong><br>
              I haven’t tried console logging yet so, I’d have to say I’m not confident using that method yet.<br>
              <br><strong>Googling</strong><br>
              Googling is my go-to method of problem solving if I can’t troubleshoot the problem myself. Very confident with this.<br>
              <br><strong>Asking peers for help</strong><br>
              I’m very confident asking my peers for help especially if we’re physically working at the same location.<br>
              <br><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong><br>
              I don’t think I’ve ever been so stuck that I needed a coaches help yet. But if my peers and all else failed I’d be pretty confident asking them for help.<br>
              <br><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong><br>
              Writing the reflections has been somewhat helpful and I’m pretty confident doing them but I’m not sure how motivated I would be to do them if I weren’t doing a course in a student position.

            <h3>JS Arrays</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>.map()</strong><br>
              Makes a new array containing the results of using a pre-defined function on all of the elements in this array.<br>
              <strong>.filter()</strong><br>
              Creates a new array with all of the elements of this array which pass the test associated with the original array. E.g. you can filter arrays by the length of the strings inside it.<br>
              <strong>.reduce()</strong><br>
              Apply a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) as to reduce it to a single value.
