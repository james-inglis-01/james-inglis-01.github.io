              <strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong><br />
              Compared to HTML and CSS, JavaScript is much more complex and harder to learn. It requires a more conceptual way of thinking in order to understand it, unlike HTML and CSS you don’t always have a visual reference to test and see if it worked or not.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong><br />
              Control flow statements are used to make decisions about what happens in a program, like when to start and stop. Loops are used for repetitive operations in JavaScript, they will repeat the same code until a condition returns false or true, the programmer can control how much the loop increments or decrements each time the loop operates. We could look at a scenario from everyday life to illustrate control flow and loops. For example let’s look at the control flow statement “if”. “If” you are hungry eat sandwiches until you are full. This is similar to a “while” loop inside an “if” statement because if you’re hungry you can keep eating sandwiches until you’ve had enough, this is just like a loop running until a condition returns true! Therefore the code is complete.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</strong><br />
              In order to access data from arrays you need to understand zero-based indexing, basically an array is like a list that holds basic data types like numbers strings and booleans. If you want to access the first piece of data, you must remember that it is assigned to 0. The next piece of data is 1 and so on. Objects store data differently, let’s use a car as an example. A car is an object, a car has properties like model weight and colour. These properties have values like silvia, 1200kg and white. To access this data After creating our objects we have to add code to access these properties. Notice that we can save a car’s model, "silvia", into a global variable model1. We do this with var model1 = car.model1;.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong><br />
              Programming is a way to give instructions to a computer, functions are a way to get the computer to do tasks for us. A JavaScript function is the fundamental building block of programming, to use a function you must define it first somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it. Functions are useful because instead of repeating the same set of instructions to the computer every time we can make use of a function. Imagine making some pottery, the methods used to make a pot and decorate it may vary, but you always have to put it in the kiln. The step of putting it in the kiln stays the same, so instead of repeating those instructions we could just say kiln and the person would know what to do. That’s basically how a function works.
