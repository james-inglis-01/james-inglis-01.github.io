    <h1>Time & Habits</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        <strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong><br>
        I tried the Pomodoro technique of using 25 minutes at a time to work on something then give myself a 5 minute break.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What did you find interesting?</strong><br>
        I found it interesting that in order to create a new habit the task needs to be simple when you're starting out. Combining these small habits over time is what leads to major changes in your life.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What worked for you?</strong><br>
        I find that meditating for 15 minutes really calms me and gives me intense focus once I've snapped out of it. I've been meditating for a few months now and it's really helping to reduce anxiety also.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Which will you experiment further with?</strong><br>
        I'll create a habit of practicing my touch typing on typingstudy.com each day to improve my skills.
