    <p>
        <strong>What is grid based design?</strong><br>
        It’s a way of dividing up a webpage using rows and columns. People usually follow the same pattern when looking at a page, left to right then top to bottom. Therefore the info you want the user to see first should be placed at the top of the page. I’ll use bootstrap’s system as an example. Each row and column’s dimensions can be changed to accommodate a design. Each row can be divided into columns of varying sizes, to put content in.<br>
        <br><strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong><br>
        A responsive webpage will conform to the size of screen the user has without losing its quality of design or content. No matter what kind of device is used, a responsive webpage will adapt allowing a greater number of people access to the webpage.<br>
        <br><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong><br>
        Semantic elements describe what kind of content they contain to browsers and developers. For example form, table, and article - clearly defines its content. It’s good practice to use the appropriate tags if you want certain content to standout for instance you’d use an h1 tag for a title and h4 tag for more specific information.<br>
        <br><strong>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</strong><br>
        I’m interested in the typefaces that can be used on my website through use of the stylesheet. I plan on looking through google fonts and font pair to see which fonts look good together. I want to reflect on how I can make my website look a bit more impressive by changing fonts and deciding on a colour scheme.
