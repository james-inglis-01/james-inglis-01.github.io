                    The process over product approach caused me to spend less time on styling my site and more time focusing on the new framework and getting it to work properly. Before reading the second chapter of Search Inside Yourself I’d been getting into the habit of meditating for ten minutes with the goal being to do it everyday. Prior to starting the EDA bootcamp I’d been introduced to mindfulness meditation in order to deal with pre-existing anxiety issues. I found that meditation was a great tool to lessen the effect of anxiety both physically and mentally. After reading the latest chapter I learned that the act of realising when you’re getting distracted and bringing attention back to your breathing is similar to building muscles at the gym. Eventually you’ll be able to get to the point that you’ll be able to relax and focus on things much better even when you’re not meditating. I think I’ll probably pay more attention to my posture more when I meditate. I tend to slouch a bit while Meng suggests a straighter back is recommended.
