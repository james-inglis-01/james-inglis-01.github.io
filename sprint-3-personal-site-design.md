My site's primary purpose is to document my learning of web development, and showcase my work. This site will show people what I'm capable and how they can contact me.

I want to appeal to people who are interested or involved in the digital industry and potential employers.

It should be welcoming with a lighthearted but honest look at learning web dev. I want visitors to find it easy to navigate around my site. I want them to find it uncluttered but also visually interesting.

I'll redesign my site using the skeleton framework. The site first and foremost needs to be made responsive. After that I can focus on streamlining the look by choosing a less distracting background and typefaces.
